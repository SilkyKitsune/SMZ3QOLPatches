# SMZ3QOLPatches
Some quality of life patches ported from VARIA randomizer for SMZ3.

### Important Notes
- The ips files are the only thing you need to download, you'll have to apply them individually with something like LunarIPS.
- Text documents show how the addresses have been adjusted for SMZ3.

### Patches
- elevators_speed_smz3 increases elevator speed in Super Metroid.
- fast_doors_smz3 increases door transition speed in Super Metroid.
- Infinite_Space_Jump_smz3 removes all limitation of Space Jump so it may be spammed freely.
- spinjumprestart_smz3 allows pressing jump to begin spinning during a non-spinning jump.
- refill_before_save_smz3 fully refills energy, missile, supers, and power bombs when using a save station just like Samus's ship does.
