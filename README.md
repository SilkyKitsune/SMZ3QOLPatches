# SMZ3QOLPatches
Some quality of life patches ported from VARIA randomizer for SMZ3.

### Important Notes
- The ips files are the only thing you need to download, you'll have to apply them individually with something like LunarIPS.
- Text documents show how the addresses have been adjusted for SMZ3.

### Patches
- elevators_speed_smz3 increases elevator speed in Super Metroid.
- fast_doors_smz3 increases door transition speed in Super Metroid.
