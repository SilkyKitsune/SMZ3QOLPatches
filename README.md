# SMZ3 Quality of Life Patches
Some quality of life patches ported from VARIA randomizer for SMZ3.

### Important Info
- The IPS files are the only thing you need to download, you'll have to apply them individually with something like LunarIPS.
- Text documents show how the addresses have been adjusted for SMZ3.

[**Infinite Space Jump**](VARIA%20Patches/Infinite_Space_Jump_smz3.ips "Infinite_Space_Jump_smz3.ips") (original developed by MetConst)

[**Nerfed Charge**](VARIA%20Patches/nerfed_charge_smz3.ips "nerfed_charge_smz3.ips") (original developed by Smiley & Flo)
- Samus begins with a starter Charge Beam that does one third of charged shot damage, effectively bringing a nerfed charge shot damage to a standard shot damage, but that can damage bosses.
- Pseudo Screws also do one third damage.
- Special Beam Attacks do normal damage but cost 3 Power Bombs instead of 1.
- Once the Charge Beam item has been collected, it does full damage and special attacks are back to normal.

[**MSU1**](VARIA%20Patches/supermetroid_msu1_smz3.ips "supermetroid_msu1_smz3.ips") (original developed by ???)
- adds msu1 compatibility to the Super Metroid side
- this patch partially writes over the title art, it is only a small visual problem and does not cause any real bugs
